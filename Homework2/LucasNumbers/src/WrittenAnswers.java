 * Lucas Numbers:
 * 
 * Ã‰douard Lucas is known primarly for his work with the Lucas number sequence, 
 * however he also has famous for his work with the primality of numbers and Umbral Calculus 
 * 
 * The calculation ratio of lucas numbers aka the ratio of the current number to the last number
 * is the golden ratio, which is approximately 1.61803398875
 * 
 * The time ratio of the current time to the previous time is near 1.0, which means that the 
 * time taken to generate each number is relatively constant, however the number does grow with the calculation 
 * amount, making it a linear time complexity
 * 
 * For Palumbo numbers, the calculation ratio is about 1.26, which is the different than the lucas numbers,
 * and the time ratio is about 1.0, which is the same as the lucas numbers
 * 
 * Magic Square:
 * 
 * There are 88 combinations of 4 numbers that add up to 33 in the magic square
 * 
 * There are 310 total combinations that add up to 33 in the magic square
 * 
 * The largest sum of the magic square is 132
